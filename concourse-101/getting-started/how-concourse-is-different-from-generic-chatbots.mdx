title: "How Concourse is different from generic chatbots / OOTB LLMs"
---

Generic chatbots are not connected to your systems of record. They do not know your chart of accounts, metrics, or business model, and they often hallucinate numbers.

Instead of relying on a generic chatbot, Concourse stacks domain expertise on top of the best foundation models.

We layer finance and operator‑specific knowledge, schemas, and workflows on top of state‑of‑the‑art LLMs so the AI:

- Understands common finance and FP&A patterns out of the box
- Knows how to work with real-world data structures from ERPs, CRMs, and warehouses
- Prioritizes correctness and clarity over “creative” answers

By constraining the model with finance context and your own definitions, Concourse can be both powerful and predictable.

### Transparent by design

Most AI tools answer in a black box. Concourse is built to show its work.

When you ask a question, Concourse:

- Surfaces the **agent’s reasoning steps** so you can see how it approached the problem
- Exposes the **exact SQL queries** it runs against your data sources
- Lets you **inspect and rerun** those queries so you can validate numbers and tweak the analysis

This transparency gives finance teams confidence that:

- Numbers tie back to trusted systems and auditable logic
- You can always trace a chart or narrative back to the underlying data and query
- Disagreements turn into concrete edits to logic or assumptions, not arguments with a black box
