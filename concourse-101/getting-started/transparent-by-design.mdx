Most AI tools answer in a black box. Concourse is built to show its work.

When you ask a question, Concourse:

- Surfaces the **agent’s reasoning steps** so you can see how it approached the problem

- Exposes the **exact SQL queries** it runs against your data sources

- Lets you **inspect and rerun** those queries so you can validate numbers and tweak the analysis

This transparency gives finance teams confidence that:

- Numbers tie back to trusted systems and auditable logic

- You can always trace a chart or narrative back to the underlying data and query

- Disagreements turn into concrete edits to logic or assumptions, not arguments with a black box
