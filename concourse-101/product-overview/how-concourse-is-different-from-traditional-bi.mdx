title: "How Concourse is different from traditional BI"
---

Traditional BI tools are great for static dashboards and pre-defined metrics. They are slow at:

- Answering new questions that do not fit existing dashboards
- Explaining the “why” behind a number
- Helping you ship board narratives or close packages on a tight deadline

Concourse is designed for the workflows where BI falls short:

- Freeform questions and follow-ups ("what changed and why?", "show this by cohort", "add a forecast")
- Fast narrative generation for close reviews, board decks, and investor updates
- Direct ownership by finance and operators, without needing a dedicated analytics engineer for every change
