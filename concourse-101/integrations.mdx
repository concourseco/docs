Concourse plugs into the systems finance teams already use today.

You can connect:

- **Data warehouses** – for centralized metrics and models (for example, Snowflake, BigQuery).
- **Finance and billing** – ERP, billing, and payments (for example, Stripe, QuickBooks Online, NetSuite)
- **HRIS** – headcount and compensation (for example, Rippling, Gusto, Workday)
- **CRM and GTM** – pipeline and revenue (for example, HubSpot, Salesforce)
- **Analytics and product data** – product usage and events (for example, PostHog)
- **CSVs** – CSVs let you bring data into Concourse when a live integration is not available or if you’re looking to work with a very specific and often smaller dataset
