You are trusting Concourse with sensitive financial and operational data. We treat that responsibility seriously.

Key principles:

- **SOC 2** – Concourse operates with SOC 2–aligned controls and practices for handling customer data.
- **Data stays in your systems** – Wherever possible, data remains in your connected systems of record. Concourse stores only what is required to power analysis, collaboration, and memories.
- **No training on your data** – Your company’s data is not used to train shared models. Prompts, outputs, and metadata are only used to serve your workspace.
- **Alerts** – Key actions such as connecting integrations are logged so you can see who did what and when.
