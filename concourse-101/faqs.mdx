**Does Concourse replace our BI tool?**

Not always. Many teams keep BI for stable dashboards and use Concourse for fast analysis, monthly close workflows, and narrative-heavy reporting like board decks.

**Where does the data actually live?**

Your data stays in your existing systems such as your warehouse, ERP, billing, and HRIS. Concourse reads from these sources and caches only what it needs to power analysis and collaboration.

**Can I trust the numbers?**

Yes, because they come from your systems of record. You can inspect queries, drill into underlying records, and reconcile against your existing dashboards.

**What happens if the AI is wrong or I do not agree with the conclusions?**

You are always in control. Ask Concourse to show its work, adjust assumptions or definitions, and refine the prompt until the output matches your view of the business.

**Is my data used to train public models?**

No. Your data is not used to train models outside your workspace.

**Can I export my analysis from Concourse?**

Yes. You can email report summaries, generate and share slide decks as Microsoft PowerPoint files, and export CSVs you can open in tools like Microsoft Excel or your BI stack.

**What systems can I connect?**
