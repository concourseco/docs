title: "Choose the right level of structure"
---

More structure is not always better. Use the right level of detail for what you are trying to do.

- For **quick exploration and data discovery**, keep prompts fast and conversational:
  - "Show me ARR by customer."
  - "Which segments drove the change in gross margin last quarter?"

  This gives the agent more discretion to decide what views and cuts are most useful.
- For **repeatable analysis**, use more structured prompts but still leave room for judgment:
  - "Break down net revenue change in Q3 vs Q2 by product line and region, and call out the top 5 drivers."
  - "Draft a monthly close summary focused on revenue, gross margin, and opex vs budget."

  These are great when you know the shape of the answer you want, but do not need every word specified.
- For **templates and documentation-level workflows**, go fully structured:
  - "Create a monthly revenue report with sections for: (1) summary, (2) chart of ARR by segment, (3) table of top 20 customers by change in ARR, (4) drivers analysis with 3 bullets per driver, (5) risks and follow-ups. Output in markdown that I can paste into our board deck doc."

  Use this when you want something consistent and shareable that you will run many times.

Overall guidance: **start simple, refine or template when needed, and only go fully structured when you want something consistent and shareable.**
