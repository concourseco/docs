Before you type, think about what you would ask an analyst.

Good starter frames:

- "Show me ARR by customer and highlight the top 20 logos by change vs last month."
- "Give me a first-pass monthly close summary for \<month\>."
- "Prepare something I can paste into a Slack update for the exec team about \<topic\>."

You can always tighten or redirect on the next turn.
