title: "Anchor the scope: time, entities, and cuts"

The more clearly you set the boundaries, the less back-and-forth you need.

- **Time frame** – "Last 12 months", "Q4 2025", "Year-to-date vs prior year".
- **Entities** – "By product line", "for our Enterprise segment only", "for self-serve customers".
- **Cuts and filters** – "Exclude one-time credits", "focus on customers with ARR \> \$50k", "only show US + Canada".

Example (balanced between Ask and Build):

"Why did net revenue change in Q3 vs Q2? Break it down by product line and region. Exclude customers with ARR under \$10k."
