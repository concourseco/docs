You do not need the perfect prompt up front. Think in passes.

1. Start broad (Ask Mode):

   "Give me a monthly close summary for November, focusing on revenue and gross margin."
2. Tighten (toward Build Mode):

   "Shorten this to 3 bullet points suitable for a quick team update."
3. Deep dive:

   "Now drill into the top 5 drivers of gross margin change by product line."

Short, directional follow-ups like "narrow to enterprise", "add charts", or "make this more executive-ready" work well.

Because Concourse is transparent by design, you can always look at the reasoning and SQL, adjust logic, re-run queries, and converge on a version you trust.
