title: "Call out key definitions and assumptions"

Concourse can use your memories, but it helps to be explicit when it matters.

- "Use our finance definition of Active Customer, not raw signups."
- "Treat expansion as upgrades within the same logo only."
- "Use GAAP revenue, not billing-based revenue."

If you see something off, correct it once:

- "When I say Active Customer, I mean customers with at least one invoice in the last 90 days."

Concourse can turn that into a reusable memory so future prompts stay consistent.
