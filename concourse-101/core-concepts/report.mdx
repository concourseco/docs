title: "Report"
---

Once you get a workbook or analysis in Concourse to a state you want to reuse and compare against in future periods, you can **turn that workbook into a report**.

A report:

- Preserves the layout, prompts, and commentary style from the original workbook
- Becomes a reusable frame of reference for future periods (for example, month-over-month or quarter-over-quarter comparisons)
- Can be scheduled or triggered so you are not rebuilding the same analysis from scratch each time

You can run the underlying workbook that powers a report:

- **On conditions** – for example, if vendor spend for Microsoft (MSFT) increases by more than 20%, or gross margin drops below 40%
- **On a schedule** – for example, on the first of every month or every 30 days to support periodic close reviews, board reporting, or other repeatable deliverables

In other words, reports turn your best analyses into proactive, reusable workflows so you always have an "analyst" running in the background.
