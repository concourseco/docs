title: "Prompt library"
---

Concourse makes it easy to reuse the prompts that work best for your team.

You can:

- **Save prompts** you like into your own library so you can rerun them without rebuilding the instructions from scratch.
- **Organize a prompt library** around your core workflows and metrics so common questions are always a click away.

Concourse also includes **pre-built prompt templates** for common finance workflows, such as:

- Month-over-month flux analysis
- Expense by vendor analysis

You can start from these templates, then adapt and save them so they reflect your definitions, segments, and reporting style.
