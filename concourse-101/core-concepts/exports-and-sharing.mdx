title: "Exports and sharing"

Concourse is built so insights do not stay trapped in the tool. You should expect to export and share what you find as part of your regular workflow.

With Concourse you can:

- **Email report summaries** directly to stakeholders so everyone sees the same numbers and commentary.
- **Generate and share slide decks** for board, leadership, and team reviews, exporting into formats like Microsoft PowerPoint and Word.
- **Export CSV data** generated by Concourse agents so you can do further analysis in spreadsheets, BI tools, or ad hoc models

The goal is not to replace every place you work today. Concourse helps you get to trusted answers quickly, then makes it easy to move those answers into the channels and formats your team already uses.
