A **workbook** is your home base for a specific workflow or question set.

Think:

- "Month-End Close – December 2025"
- "Q1 Board – Metrics & Commentary"
- "Weekly Business Review"

Inside a workbook you can:

- Group related analyses into one place
- Keep numbers, commentary, and context together
- Build powerful and detailed visuals to easily interpret your data
