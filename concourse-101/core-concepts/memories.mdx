title: "Memories"
---

**Memories** capture the way your company talks and thinks about the business.

You can store things like:

- How you define “Active Customer”, “Net Retention”, or “Qualified Pipeline”
- Key strategic priorities
- Business-unit, region, and segment definitions

Concourse uses memories to:

- Apply the same definitions every time
- Avoid asking you for basic context on every analysis
- Generate commentary that sounds like your finance team, not a generic model

As you build analyses, Concourse will often **suggest new memories** based on how you describe metrics, segments, or assumptions. You stay in control: you can accept suggestions that should be remembered going forward, or keep them one-off for that workbook only.
