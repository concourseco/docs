When a new question comes in, you should not have to wait days for a custom report.

Use Concourse to:

- Answer questions like "Which customers increased usage after we launched Feature X?"
- Break down churn by industry, deal size, or cohort
- Run quick cuts for leadership meetings and Slack threads

Start with a natural-language question, let Concourse draft a report, then refine until it is ready to share.
